**All deliverables are due Friday by 6:00pm PDT**

* **Project Proposal:** Week 4
* **User Stories:** Week 5
* **Development Plan:** Week 6

1. figure out a timeline 
2.create a list of tasks (for this we should go over all of our pod sync meet notes)
3. give everyone roles (once we have a basic layout of what our timeline looks like and what we plan on implementing, we can give everyone roles)
